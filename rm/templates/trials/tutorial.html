            Here are some examples of good titles to get you started:

            headache pain can be measured on a severity scale from 0 to 10.<br />
            -       Binary: these are outcomes that are either present or absent. For example,
            you could have vomited, or not vomited.<br />
            -       Count: these are variables that are counted. For example, the number of
            wees you have in 24 hours.

            Write your description of the trial here. If you publish this trial,

            You can also upload an image to go along with your trial.
            This will be displayed on the advert page for your trial, and should
            be a .png or .jpg file.

            When you click the randomise me button, you'll be randomised to one of two
            groups. These are the instructions for the two groups, and are the key
            thing that differentiates them.

            Once you've created your trial, you're ready to start reporting data.
            You should click the Randomise Me button, which will randomly assign you
            to one of the arms of your trial, and display your current instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you have your instructions you're ready to take some action...

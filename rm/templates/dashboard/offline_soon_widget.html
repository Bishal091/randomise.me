        We are still working on our offline trials feature,
        for when you want to answer questions about
        a sample that already exists offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll help
        you design a great trial, allocate your sample,
        and run the stats when you're done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as soon as it's ready, it'll be available here.

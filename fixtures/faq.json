We simply take a group of children, or schools (or patients, or people); we split them into two groups at random; we give one intervention to one group, and the other intervention to the other group; then we measure how each group is doing, to see if one intervention achieved its supposed outcome any better.\r\n\r\nThis is how medicines are tested, and in most circumstances it would be regarded as dangerous for anyone to use a treatment today, without ensuring that it had been shown to work well in a randomised trial. Trials are not only used in medicine, however, and it is common to find them being used in fields as diverse as web design, retail, government, and development work around the world.\r\n\r\nFor example, there was a longstanding debate about which of two competing models of \u201cmicrofinance\u201d schemes was best at getting people out of poverty in India, whilst ensuring that the money was paid back, so it could be re-used in other villages: a randomised trial compared the two models, and established which was best.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the page at Wikipedia, when they are having a funding drive, you can see the smiling face of Jimmy Wales, the founder, on a fundraising advert. He\u2019s a fairly shy person, and didn\u2019t want his face to be on these banners. But Wikipedia ran a randomised trial, assigning visitors to different adverts: some saw an advert with a child from the developing world (\u201cshe could have access to all of human knowledge if you donate\u2026\u201d); some saw an attractive young intern; some saw Jimmy Wales. The adverts with Wales got more clicks and more donations than the rest, so they were used universally.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine that there are ways around the inconvenience of randomly assigning people, or schools, to one intervention or another: surely, you might think, we could just look at the people who are already getting one intervention, or another, and simply monitor their outcomes to find out which is the best. But this approach suffers from a serious problem. If you don\u2019t randomise, and just observe what\u2019s happening in classrooms already, then the people getting different interventions might be very different from each other, in ways that are hard to measure.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you look across the country, children who are taught to read in one particularly strict and specific way at school may perform better on a reading test at age 7, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the strict, specific reading method was responsible for their better performance. It may just be that schools with more affluent children, or fewer social problems, are more able to get away with using this (imaginary) strict reading method, and their pupils were always going to perform better on reading tests at age 7.\r\n\r\nThis is also a problem when you are rolling out a new policy, and hoping to find out whether it works better than what\u2019s already in place. It is tempting to look at results before and after a new intervention is rolled out, but this can be very misleading, as other factors may have changed at the same time. For example, if you have a \u201cback to work\u201d scheme that is supposed to get people on benefits back into employment, it might get implemented across the country at a time when the economy is picking up anyway, so more people will be finding jobs, and you might be misled into believing that it was your \u201cback to work\u201d scheme that did the job (at best, you\u2019ll be tangled up in some very complex and arbitrary mathematical modelling, trying to discount for the effects of the economy picking up).\r\n\r\nSometimes people hope that running a pilot is a way around this, but this is also a mistake. Pilots are very informative about the practicalities of whether your new intervention can be implemented, but they can be very misleading on the benefits or harms, because the centres that participate in pilots are often different to the centres that don\u2019t. For example, job centres participating in a \u201cback to work\u201d pilot might be less busy, or have more highly motivated staff: their clients were always going to do better, so a pilot in those centres will make the new jobs scheme look better than it really is. Similarly, running a pilot of a fashionable new educational intervention in schools that are already performing well might make the new idea look fantastic, when in reality, the good results have nothing to do with the new intervention.\r\n\r\nThis is why randomised trials are the best way to find out how well a new intervention works: they ensure that the pupils or schools getting a new intervention are the same as the pupils and schools still getting the old one, because they are all randomly selected from the same pool.", "updated_on": "2013-06-17T16:10:20.031Z", "sort_order": 0, "slug": "how-do-rcts-work"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "faq.question", "fields": {"status": 1, "updated_by": 1, "text": "What is a Power Calculation?", "created_by": 1, "topic": 2, "created_on": "2013-06-14T15:32:16Z", "protected": false, "answer": "\r\nThe power of a statistical test is the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (i.e. the probability of not committing a Type II error, hence the probability of confirming the alternative hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true).

As the power increases, the chances of a Type II error occurring decrease. The probability of a Type II error occurring is referred to as the false negative rate (\u03b2).

You heard science works well for this. You probably heard about fair tests at school......\r\n\r\n### THE CONCEPT OF A <span class=\"red bold\">FAIR TEST</span> (A RECAP)\r\n\r\nLet's pretend we're doing an experiment to see if fertilizer makes a plant grow to be larger than a plant that doesn't receive fertilizer. We put seeds of the same kind in three pots with fertilizer and rich soil. But, we run out of soil so we put the seeds without fertilizer in three pots filled with sand. We put all six pots in the same location and water each one with the same amount of water every other day. The plants with soil and fertilizer grow to be much larger than the ones grown in sand without fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIs that a fair test of whether fertilizer makes a plant grow to be larger? No! We changed two things (type of soil and fertilizer) so we have no idea whether the plants with fertilizer grew to be larger because of the fertilizer or whether the other plants were stunted by being grown in sand. It wasn't a fair test! All of the plants should have been in the same kind of soil.

The BIG IDEA is that if we randomly allocate ourselves to be exposed to the thing of interest (or not exposed to it) in the right way then we can find out what the thing of interest is doing. This is because the effect of the things we're not interested in testing should balance out between the groups since used randomisation ....
